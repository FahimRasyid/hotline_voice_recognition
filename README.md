# hotline_voice_recognition
This is my Final Project for Bachelor Degree. I use Python programming language to build program either backend or frontend.  Voice frequency was extracted using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) method. Vector Quantization method and Euclidean Distance are method for classification between voice data input and data training.
